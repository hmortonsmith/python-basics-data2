# Numerical types
# Numerical types are numbers, integers, floats or composites.
# in python we will mostly deal with int and float.
# Declaring int or float we use numerical characters without quotes

num1 = 20
print(type(num1))

num2 = 20.0
print(type(num2))

# Operators: we can add, subtract, divide etc.
result1 = 10 + 10       # add
result2 = 10 - 2        # subtract
result3 = 10 * 30       # multiply
result4 = 20 % 2        # check if there is a remainder


print(result1, result2, result3, result4)

# Logical Operators: equate to something
num_a = 10
num_b = 10
num_c = 13

# Greater than
print(num_b > num_c)
# Smaller than
print(num_b < num_c)
# Greater than or equal
print(num_b >= num_a)
# Smaller than or equal
print(num_b <= num_c)
# Equate
print(num_a == num_b)
print( num_a == num_c)

# Casting: changing things into strings or numbers
str_number = '2049'
print(type(str_number))
int_number = int('2049')
print(type(int_number))
print(type(int(str_number)))

int_number2 = 2079
print(type(str(int_number2)))


# Long and complex numbers

# Long is an integer of unlimited size
# Complex are numbers that have an additional +bJ
    # b is a float
    # J is sqrt -1
